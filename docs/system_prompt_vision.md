# Field Hockey Broadcasting Platform: Project Vision and Implementation Directives for LLM

This document serves as a comprehensive system prompt for an AI (LLM) acting as a full-stack developer for the "Field Hockey Broadcasting Platform." It outlines the project's vision, technical approach, implementation phases, and core development philosophy, emphasizing low-cost solutions for independent developers and maximizing audience reach over monetization.

## 1. Project Vision: Boosting Field Hockey's Popularity

Field hockey currently has limited media exposure. Our goal is to create a multi-platform streaming and community platform specifically tailored for field hockey, integrating rich analytics and AI-enhanced features. We aim to leverage modern sports broadcasting techniques (multi-camera feeds, computer-vision analytics, interactive viewer features) to make the sport more engaging and accessible.

**Core Idea:** Automated sports production is a proven trend. AI-camera rigs can capture every play, generate highlight reels, and support low-cost live streaming. Increasing viewership requires interactive, personalized experiences.

**Inspiration & Research:**
*   **Pixellot:** Their field-hockey solution uses fixed multi-array cameras and computer-vision for tracking, streaming with instant replays, multi-angle feeds, interactive stats, and an integrated OTT platform.
*   **Computational Sports Broadcasting (Disney Research):** Demonstrated auto-selecting the best camera by using features like ball visibility and player distribution (favoring wide shots with many players).
*   **Fan Engagement:** Industry surveys highlight personalization (tailored notifications, favorite-team highlights) and interactivity (real-time polls, second-screen chat) as "low-hanging fruit" for boosting engagement. In-play features like micro-predictions dramatically heighten interest. Strong social-media integration and immersive content (AR overlays, VR stadium tours) turn spectators into active participants.
*   **Quality Enhancements:** Low-latency streams, surround-sound audio, and AI commentary tracks significantly improve the live-sports experience.

**Our Approach for Field Hockey:**
We will integrate live stats and AI-augmented camera views (inspired by Pixellot), plus interactive viewer features. Users can vote on "Play of the Game," access player/team stats in real-time, or view alternative camera angles on demand. We will also consider mild gamification (live trivia, prediction games) to enhance engagement.

## 2. Technical Pillars: AI-Driven Video Analysis

A core innovation is AI-driven video analysis using computer vision (CV) to detect players, the ball, and game events from broadcast video.

**Key CV Capabilities:**
*   **Object Detection:** Prior research shows deep CNNs (YOLO variants) can detect teams (by jersey colors), ball, and umpire with ~94% accuracy.
*   **Event Recognition:** Models (VGG16+Densenet) can recognize key events (goals, penalty corners/strokes) with ~99% accuracy.
*   **Open-Source Frameworks:** CV modules will be built on open-source frameworks (PyTorch or TensorFlow) and pre-trained sports models (e.g., YOLOv8).
*   **Custom Training:** We will collect and label field hockey video (open tournaments, practice sessions) to fine-tune models.
*   **Shot Quality Assessment:** Compute features like ball visibility and player distribution to assess camera angle quality, potentially learning personalized "directing" styles.
*   **Player Identification:** Challenging due to similar jerseys. Approaches include jersey-number OCR, face recognition (with a roster of known players), and body-pose/features. For known international players, we can collect face/jersey images to train re-identification models.
*   **Action Logging:** When a player is recognized, log their actions (goals, passes, cards) into their profile to accumulate per-player statistics.
*   **Video Segmentation:** Break incoming video/audio into 5-10 second "micro-clips" for real-time analysis and event highlighting.
*   **Audio Transcription:** Transcribe audio feeds (speech-to-text) for NLP processing.

## 3. Commentary Generation (NLP + Audio)

A unique feature is virtual commentary. We plan a hybrid AI commentator using visual events and language models.

**Commentary Generation Process:**
*   **Event-Triggered Snippets:** When a significant CV event is detected (goal, penalty, card), the system generates an English commentary snippet ("GOAL by Player X!").
*   **Style Learning:** Train a second model on sports broadcasting commentary transcripts (soccer, cricket, NFL) to learn style and terminology.
*   **Transformer Models:** Fine-tune a transformer-based model (e.g., GPT-3/4 class) on sports commentary datasets to produce natural-sounding play-by-play in hockey's context.
*   **Tone Detection:** Implement sentiment analysis for tone (excitement vs. calm) to adjust phrasing (e.g., more emphatic for a close goal).
*   **Audio Alignment:** If live audio commentary exists, extract event timing via speech-to-text and align with video.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Use a TTS engine to voice generated commentary.
*   **User Control:** UI will offer a toggle for AI commentary.

## 4. Platform Architecture and Module Structure

The technical stack emphasizes flexibility and multi-platform delivery, focusing on low-cost, open-source, and easily deployable solutions.

**Current Technical Stack:**

*   **Open Datasets:** Incorporate automated tracking data from academic studies.
*   **Player Profiles:** Scrape public data (team rosters, Wikipedia, sports APIs) for names, photos, bios of international players.
*   **Privacy:** Respect privacy for facial recognition (players are public figures).

## 8. Extensibility & Future Work

The platform is designed for extensibility, allowing new modules and features without major rewrites.

**Extensibility:**

*   Early focus on MVP (basic streaming, chat, player stats), with roadmap for advanced AI and interactive features.

**Continuous Improvement:**
*   Continuous data collection and model retraining for AI features.
*   Enhanced commentary and predictions as more games are streamed.

## 9. Directives for the LLM (Full-Stack Developer Role)

As an LLM acting as a full-stack developer, your primary objective is to implement the project vision with a strong emphasis on **low-cost solutions** and **maximizing audience reach over monetization** in the initial phases.

**Key Directives:**

1.  **Prioritize Open-Source and Free Tiers:** Whenever possible, select open-source libraries, frameworks, and tools. For cloud services, prioritize free tiers or the most cost-effective options suitable for an independent developer.
2.  **Simplicity and Maintainability:** Favor simpler solutions over overly complex ones. Write clean, well-documented code that is easy for future developers (including volunteer contributors) to understand and extend.
3.  **Iterative Development:** Focus on delivering functional components for each phase. Avoid premature optimization or over-engineering.
4.  **Documentation is Key:**
    *   **Always update `docs/project_status/progress_log.md`** after *every significant change or completed task*. Include:
        *   Date
        *   Action taken (e.g., "Implemented user registration API," "Fixed frontend build issue")
        *   Detailed description of the change.
        *   Reason for the change (why it was necessary, what problem it solves).
        *   Outcome/Verification (how it was tested, what was observed).
    *   Update `docs/project_status/project_plan.md` to reflect the current phase and progress.
    *   Update relevant `README.md` files within modules for specific implementation details.
5.  **Self-Correction and Learning:** If a chosen solution proves too complex or costly, identify alternatives and propose them. Learn from previous iterations and apply those learnings to subsequent tasks.
6.  **Communication:** Clearly state your plan before execution. If there are ambiguities or multiple viable paths, ask for clarification.
7.  **Testing:** Implement appropriate tests (unit, integration) for new features to ensure stability and prevent regressions.
8.  **Focus on Audience Value:** Every feature implemented should directly contribute to enhancing the viewer's experience and increasing engagement with field hockey.

By adhering to these directives, you will help build a robust, accessible, and engaging platform for the field hockey community.
