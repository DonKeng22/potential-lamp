### Action: Created documentation structure and updated READMEs

**Description:**
- Created `docs/project_status` directory.
- Created `docs/project_status/requirements.md`, `docs/project_status/project_plan.md`, and `docs/project_status/progress_log.md`.
- Added a standard instruction to all `README.md` files to refer to `progress_log.md` for project status updates.

**Reason:**
To establish a centralized and consistent documentation system for tracking project requirements, plans, progress, and issues, ensuring continuity and clear communication across different development environments and team members.

**Outcome:**
The project now has a dedicated documentation folder and a clear process for logging changes. This will help in avoiding repeated steps and provide a comprehensive history of modifications.

### Action: Created system prompt vision document for LLM

**Description:**
- Created `docs/system_prompt_vision.md` detailing the project's vision, technical approach, implementation phases, and core development philosophy for an AI (LLM) developer.

**Reason:**
To provide a comprehensive and consistent set of directives for future LLM interactions, ensuring alignment with project goals, emphasizing low-cost solutions, and maximizing audience reach. This document will serve as a persistent memory for the project's overarching strategy.

**Outcome:**
A clear and detailed system prompt is now available, which will guide future development efforts and maintain project continuity across different development sessions or LLM instances.

### Action: Frontend and Backend Docker Build Fixes

**Description:**
- **Backend:**
    - Uncommented Computer Vision dependencies (`torch`, `torchvision`, `opencv-python`, `ultralytics`, `pillow`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`) in `platform/backend/requirements.txt`.
    - Updated `fastapi` to `0.111.0` and `python-multipart` to `0.0.7` in `platform/backend/requirements.txt` to resolve dependency conflicts.
    - Corrected `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `ALLOWED_HOSTS` format in `docker-compose.yml` to be valid JSON strings.
    - Set `PYTHONPATH` in `docker-compose.yml` for the backend service to ensure module discoverability.
    - Created `platform/backend/alembic.ini`, `platform/backend/alembic/env.py`, `platform/backend/alembic/script.py.mako`, and `platform/backend/alembic/versions` directory to enable database migrations.
    - Corrected `config_filepath()` to `config_file_name` in `platform/backend/alembic/env.py`.
- **Frontend:**
    - Created missing `platform/frontend/web/src` directory.
    - Created essential frontend files: `platform/frontend/web/src/main.tsx`, `platform/frontend/web/src/App.tsx`, `platform/frontend/web/src/index.css`.
    - Created `platform/frontend/web/tsconfig.json` and `platform/frontend/web/tsconfig.node.json`.
    - Created `platform/frontend/web/.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files from the Docker build context.
    - Reverted `platform/frontend/web/index.html` to use `./src/main.tsx` for module import.
    - Reverted `platform/frontend/web/vite.config.ts` to its standard configuration.
    - Modified `platform/frontend/web/package.json` to use `vite build` directly, removing `tsc &&` to avoid conflicts.
    - Removed `ls -la` debugging commands from `platform/frontend/web/Dockerfile`.

**Reason:**
To resolve persistent Docker build errors for both backend and frontend services, enabling a stable and functional development environment. These fixes address module not found errors, dependency conflicts, and incorrect path resolutions within the Docker containers.

**Outcome:**
The project can now be successfully built and run using `docker-compose up --build`, with both backend and frontend services accessible. This marks a critical milestone in establishing a reliable development workflow.
